## 📝 Platform for following and delivering academic projects⏱️

ProjecTrack is an application destined to help with the remote management and delivering of academic projects, where professors can create, assign and supervise assignments, whereas students can register their progress in the form of intermediate delivers, as well as making final delivers, with the purpose of establishing effective communication, progress tracking, delivery grading and feedback delivery, all in a transparent and asynchronous manner.
